## Sync Interval

{{< youtube 0EnEkyGLH-o >}}

By default Biz Analyst checks for any changes in your **&quot;Tally ERP 9&quot;** data every 5 minutes. You may change this frequency as per your usage. If data is not changed or added often in your **Tally ERP 9** then you may increase the sync frequency. If data is changed or added very frequently then decrease the sync frequency so that you get the latest changes on your phone quickly.

To change the **Sync Frequency**, click **Settings** on the top blue bar, then click **Sync** from the left side, change the frequency minutes and click **Save** button.

## Sync Deleted Vouchers Interval

By default Biz Analyst checks for deleted vouchers in your **&quot;Tally ERP 9&quot;** every 24 hours. You may change this frequency as per your usage. If vouchers are not deleted often in your **Tally ERP 9** then you may increase the sync frequency.

To change the **Sync Deleted Vouchers Interval**, click **Settings** on the top blue bar, then click **Sync** from the left side, change the Sync deleted vouchers interval (in hours) and click **Save** button.
