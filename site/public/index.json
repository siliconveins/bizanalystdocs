	"content": " Overview Biz Analyst is a \u0026quot;Tally on mobile\u0026quot; application which sync\u0026rsquo;s your Tally ERP 9 data and shows it on your mobile. You can view Sales, Purchase, Receivable, Payable, Cash / Bank balances, Delivery Note, Receipt Note, Sales Order, Purchase Order, Party, Items, Inactive Customers, Inactive Items, Ledger Report, Day Book and many more things on your mobile.\nOur platform consists of two applications: 1. Desktop app 2. Mobile app (Android / IOS)\n1. Desktop app It is the medium which sync\u0026rsquo;s your Tally ERP 9 data with Biz Analyst Android/IOS app. It resides on your computer where Tally ERP 9 is installed.\nYou can manage (add, edit, delete) your Tally ERP 9 companies whose data you want to see on your mobile through this app.\nThe Biz Analyst Desktop app fetches data from your Tally ERP 9 (for the companies which you have added in Biz Analyst to sync) then encrypt\u0026rsquo;s that data and saves it on our server (hosted on Amazon Web Services).\nIt periodically checks for any changes in Tally ERP 9 data and only saves the new data on the server instead of fetching everything again.\nThe Sync runs automatically and no user intervention is required.\n2. Android / IOS app This is the app you install on your phone to see your synced Tally ERP 9 data. You get a list of companies from the ones you\u0026rsquo;ve added on Biz Analyst through the Desktop application.\nSelecting a company from the list downloads its corresponding data from our server to your mobile device and later on decrypt\u0026rsquo;s it for you to see.\nYou can set a Passcode (feature built-in) for the app so no other person can access your data without your permission.\n"
